          FAQ: KACS
        </h2>
        <p>
          Here, we answer some of the most frequently asked questions about the general use of the Khan Academy Computer Science platform. It offers a wide variety of features, but it does not offer extensive documentation on its use. Site questions are frustrating to answer repeatedy. This information is free to use when answering questions. You may choose to link to a particular answer, or simply copy the answer.
        </p>
        <h2 id="program-creation">
          <a href="/kacs/faq.html#program-creation" style="text-decoration:inherit;color:inherit;">How do you create a project?</a>
        </h2>
        <p>One of the most frequent subjects of questions in the KACS <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/d">discussion page</a>, project creation is also one of the easiest to answer. Simply visit one of the links below in relation to your need.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/new/pjs">New Processing.js project</a> for the standard Khan Academy programs</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/new/webpage">New webpage</a> for those interested in HTML and CSS</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/new/sql">New SQL script</a> for those who like crunching data</li>
          <li>You may even create a document which is findable in your "projects" page at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/biology/new/document">this page</a>, although this is a dysfunctional and potentially antiquated feature, and it is unknown if it will be making a return.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Keep in mind that all projects you make on those pages are private and autosaved when you close the program's tab. This changes when you save it. The program immediately becomes public (and subject to viewing on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/browse">the lists</a>).</p>
        <h2 id="what-if-i">
          <a href="/kacs/faq.html#what-if-i" style="text-decoration:inherit;color:inherit;">What if I...</a>
        </h2>
        <p><em>What if I capitalize the "e" in "ellipse"? What would happen?</em></p>
        <p><em>What if I have two draw functions in one program? What would happen?</em></p>
        <p><em>What if I make an endless recursive function? What would happen?</em></p>
        <p>Unless you need to know if it's legal, or it could cost you money, <strong>just try it</strong>. It's highly unlikely anything a novice or even a decent programmer can do on Khan Academy will be able to damage their own system. The site has extensive restrictions on what users can do. If you have legal concerns, the best policy is to look it up, not do it, or preferably both.</p>
        <h2 id="spin-offs">
          <a href="/kacs/faq.html#what-if-i" style="text-decoration:inherit;color:inherit;">What is a spin off and how can I make one?</a>
        </h2>
        <p>A spin off is simply a built in method of crediting programs you are inspired by. It creates a copy of a project, and below the vote button and name of the author of the code, it provides a link to the original program. This can be especially useful for those that want to keep records of their progress at big updates and overhauls.</p>
        <p>Now suppose I wanted to spin off my own program on nesting while loops, to show that now I know how useful they can be, but still leave that original program in my projects list. To do this, I will go to my original program:</p>
        <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/846497678673838088/846590896530915378/unknown.png" width="100%">
        <p>I click on the spin off button to the left of the save button (it'll be in that position whether or not it's on a program of yours). I'm then be promted to name it. I leave it at its default (you can choose to name it too), and click "save."</p>
        <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/846497678673838088/846582884084351066/unknown.png" width="100%">
        <p>And now, I have a link directly crediting the original program. This is particularly helpful if you're making sequels to popular games. You might even gain some traction from being in their spin off list at all.</p>
